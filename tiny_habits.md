## Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
B = MAP is BJ Fogg's behavior model, which stands for:

- **B**: Behavior (the habit you want to create)
- **M**: Motivation (your desire to do the behavior)
- **A**: Ability (how easy or difficult the behavior is)
- **P**: Prompt (a trigger that reminds you to do the behavior)

To make new habits easier, simplify the habit (increase ability), link it to an existing routine (use a prompt), and recognize that motivation can vary, so keep the habit small enough to do even when motivation is low.

### Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
Celebrating after completing a habit reinforces it by creating positive emotions, which helps to solidify the habit in your brain, making it more likely you'll repeat it.

The book's perspective on identity is that lasting behavior change comes from adopting a new identityâ€”seeing yourself as the type of person who embodies the habits you want, rather than just focusing on the actions themselves.

### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
The book suggests making a habit easier by reducing its complexity and effort. This can be done by starting with small, manageable actions, simplifying the habit, and integrating it into your existing routines to make it more automatic and less daunting.

### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
The book suggests making a habit harder to do by increasing its complexity and effort, such as adding steps or removing conveniences. This approach discourages the habit by making it less accessible and more difficult to engage in.
